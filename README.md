# ⚡🚀 100 Days of GPU Challenge 🎉🖥️

Welcome to my **100 Days of GPU** journey!  
This repository is a public log of my learning, experiments, and projects as I dive deep into the world of:

- GPU architecture  
- CUDA programming  
- Memory hierarchies  
- Parallelism  
- Acceleration for deep learning & scientific computing

🎯 The goal: Develop a strong theoretical and practical understanding of GPU-based high-performance computing.
